      <p>The Phantom of the Opera is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Charles Hart. Richard Stilgoe and Lloyd Webber wrote the musical's book together. Stilgoe also provided additional lyrics. Based on the French novel of the same name by Gaston Leroux, its central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano, Christine Daaé, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Opéra House.</p>

      <p>GIRY (to CHRISTINE)<br>
        Yes, you did well. He will be pleased.<br>
        (to the DANCERS)<br>
        And you! You were a disgrace tonight! Such ronds de
        jambe! Such temps de cuisse!<br>
        Here we rehearse. Now!<br>
        (She emphasizes this with her cane.<br>
        The BALLET GIRLS settle into rehearsal upstage, GlRY
        keeping time with her stick. Variations on this continue throughout the scene)<br>
        <br><br>
        (CHRISTINE moves slowly, downstage, away from the
        DANCERS as her dressing room becomes visible.<br>
        Unseen by her, MEG also moves away and follows her.<br>
        As CHRISTINE is about to open the dressing room door,
        she hears the PHANTOM's voice out of nowhere)<br>
        <br><br>
        PHANTOM'S VOICE <br>
        Bravi, bravi, bravissimi . . . <br></p>
